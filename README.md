- `deliveries.csv`: Contains ball-by-ball delivery data

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Success rate of teams over different seasons
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Visualization of trends using bar plots, line graphs, and pie charts

## 🔍 Sample Visualizations
- Bar plots showing team performance
- Line plots of total runs per over
- Pie charts for match win ratios

## 📂 How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the files
2. Open `IPL PROJECT.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Make sure `matches.csv` and `deliveries.csv` are in the same directory
4. Run each cell to view the output and visualizations
